# Local benchmark baseline

This is the initial local baseline for the current supported subset. It is a
comparison point for follow-up measurements on the same environment, not a
performance gate or a claim about representative SVG workloads. The `ShortRun`
job has three measured iterations, so its confidence intervals remain broad.

## Reproduction

```powershell
dotnet run -c Release --project benchmarks/Lokad.Svg.Benchmarks -- -j Short -f "*"
```

BenchmarkDotNet writes the complete raw log, CSV and HTML report under its
ignored `BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/` directory. Preserve a result separately
when comparing revisions; do not infer a regression from one run on a different
machine or runtime.

## Baseline captured 2026-09-20

- BenchmarkDotNet 0.14.0; .NET SDK 10.0.401; .NET 10.0.12 x64 RyuJIT.
- Windows 10 22H2 (10.0.19045.6456), Intel Xeon W-2223 3.60 GHz, four physical
  / eight logical cores, concurrent workstation GC.
- `ShortRun`: one launch, three warmups and three measured iterations.
- Each input is one explicitly sized SVG with a full red rectangle. Input setup
  and caller destination allocation occur outside the timed method. The stream
  methods reset the same preallocated caller-owned `MemoryStream` before every
  conversion.

Each cell is mean time followed by BenchmarkDotNet managed allocation per
conversion. It is allocation traffic, not retained memory or `RenderBudget`
peak. The probe scenarios described in the root README cover the separate
process/outcome evidence; they do not make an OS working-set measurement into a
renderer memory limit.
